# Predicting-Image-Quality-And-Transfer-Time
You want to send your national ID (a scanned version of it) from your mobile to your laptop
using Bluetooth. It is important for you to send the best quality image in minimal time. The image
quality depends on its resolution (in pixels/inch). If you try seven image resolutions, you can rate
their qualities from 1 to 7. First, train a neural network (or other suitable regression model) to
predict the file transfer time given a certain input image resolution. Second, use a multi-objective
optimization procedure to find the image resolution that achieves the best compromise between
quality and transfer time.
